# Bio-Learning

## What is bio-learning

- Using the theory of evolution to train creatures for certain target, and then transfer their experience to neural network.

## Tasks

### Task1: Trajectory Prediction of Flies in Laboratory

- Use laser guns to shoot flies, ones without capability of  predicting trajectory dies
- Flies are equipped with motion sensors, their trajectory is fed into neural network of laser gun controller
- This is a GAN method

### Task2: Multi-Flies Tracking in Laboratory
